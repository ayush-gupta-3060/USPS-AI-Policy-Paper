**Preliminary Writing Assignment**

**GOVT 1200, US Political System**

*(Due: Thursday, October 23rd at 1:30 pm via Canvas upload)*

*Assignment Description:* The purpose of the research paper assignment is to further your understanding of how a public policy domain in which you are interested connects to the broader study of political science. This preliminary assignment will guide you in starting the process of collecting the information and resources needed to complete the final research paper. *The preliminary assignment is worth **20%** of the overall paper assignment grade but will itself only be graded for on-time completion.*

**Part A**

1) Choose a public policy that you are interested in.  You can select from the list of examples below or you may choose another topic. This policy area will be the focus of this preliminary assignment as well as your final research paper.   
     
   1. Refugees  
   2. Affordable housing  
   3. Renewable energy/Oil exploration  
   4. School vouchers  
   5. LGBTQ Rights  
   6. Poverty/Homelessness  
   7. Capital Gains Taxes  
   8. Drinking water quality  
   9. US border protection  
   10. Voter identification  
   11. **AI Regulation & Governance**  
         
2) List 3 major facts or points of interest about your issue area (e.g. the performance of US schools is declining). Include citations indicating where you gathered your information. Why should we care about your topic?  Please use reputable news sources such as the *New York Times* or *Wall Street Journal* or research conducted by a think tank (e.g. Brookings) or governmental organization (e.g. Department of Justice).

1. There’s no unified federal AI law; agencies use piecemeal frameworks, and each state has its own regulations (source: [https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48555](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48555))   
2. The U.S. and EU’s diverging approaches to AI regulation mean that companies will work in vastly different regulatory environments worldwide (source: [https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-and-us-diverge-on-ai-regulation-a-transatlantic-comparison-and-steps-to-alignment/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-and-us-diverge-on-ai-regulation-a-transatlantic-comparison-and-steps-to-alignment/))   
3. The tension between innovation and safeguards is mirrored in US approaches to regulation ([https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48555](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48555)) 

**Part B**

Please choose 7 of the 10 subject areas below and provide the requested information.  In the final assignment due in November you will focus on 3 of these 7 areas in greater depth. **THERE’S 11 SUBJECT AREAS \- I did 8**

| Subject Areas | In 3-4 sentences, identify the relationship between your policy area and each aspect of American Politics you select | Suggested Sources | At least two citations |
| :---: | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Constitution and Civil Liberties/Rights | AI systems are directly implicated with many amendments of the constitution. The first amendment, as generative AI and content moderation touch on free speech. The fourth amendment, as AI-driven surveillance challenges expectations of privacy. The fourteenth amendment, as AI-driven decision-making, such as in housing, credit, or insurance, could unfairly lead to biased outcomes. |  [U.S. Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution) | [U.S. Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution) Bill of Rights?

| Federalism/ State Politics | In California, the Senate Bill 53 signed by Gavin Newsom on September 29, 2025, requires large “frontier” AI developers to publish safety frameworks, report certain high-risk incidents, and protect whistleblowers. In Colorado, Under Senate Bill 24‑205 (the Colorado AI Act), from February 1, 2026, developers and deployers of “high-risk” artificial intelligence systems in Colorado must undertake annual impact assessments, provide disclosures to consumers when AI is used in consequential decision-making, and manage known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination. In Texas, the Texas Responsible Artificial Intelligence Governance Act (TRAIGA) creates a new regulatory framework that prohibits certain harmful AI uses (such as “social scoring” and manipulative behavior), mandates transparency when government uses AI, and establishes a state-level oversight council, with the law set to take effect on January 1, 2026\. | [NCSL](http://www.ncsl.org/) [Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/laws-policies) [SPPQ](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/spa)  [Economist](http://www.economist.com/topics/american-state-politics)  | [https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/)  [https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-205](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-205)  [https://www.taftlaw.com/news-events/law-bulletins/ai-regulation-comes-to-texas/](https://www.taftlaw.com/news-events/law-bulletins/ai-regulation-comes-to-texas/)  |

| Mass Media | AI is deeply intertwined with mass media. How the media paints AI, such as either as an economic opportunity, a race vs. China, or as an existential threat, vastly colors how the public views it. For example, coverage of ChatGPT and deepfakes in 2023–2024 generated moral panic that pressured legislators to act quickly before fully understanding the technology. Also, AI in media creates a feedback loop, in which policymakers rely on media to gauge public concern, while tech companies use media narratives to lobby for self-regulation or favorable policy language. |  [FactCheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/) [Media Ideology Ranking (WaPo)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/10/21/lets-rank-the-media-from-liberal-to-conservative-based-on-their-audiences/?utm_term=.e5d39bb96276) [AllSides.com](https://www.allsides.com/) | [https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/regulating-ai-deepfakes-and-synthetic-media-political-arena](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/regulating-ai-deepfakes-and-synthetic-media-political-arena)  [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361496547\_The\_news\_framing\_of\_artificial\_intelligence\_a\_critical\_exploration\_of\_how\_media\_discourses\_make\_sense\_of\_automation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361496547_The_news_framing_of_artificial_intelligence_a_critical_exploration_of_how_media_discourses_make_sense_of_automation)  |
| Interest Groups and Lobbying | Major tech companies have a huge stake in AI regulation and governance, as regulation could directly impact their bottom line and ability to continue to innovate without government intervention. As we have seen in recent days, the president has been meeting directly with the CEOs of many of these companies, so their interests are being directly addressed by the White House. Of course, these groups are also lobbying to gain favor in the house and senate.  |  [Vote Smart Directory of Interest Organizations](https://votesmart.org/interest-groups#.Wcz30NNSw2w) [Open Secrets](http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/mems.php) | [https://time.com/6972134/ai-lobbying-tech-policy-surge/](https://time.com/6972134/ai-lobbying-tech-policy-surge/)  [https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-09-05/trump-basks-in-tech-leaders-spending-vows-at-white-house-dinner](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-09-05/trump-basks-in-tech-leaders-spending-vows-at-white-house-dinner)  |
| Political Parties | There seems to be bipartisan agreement that AI can have many harms, such as election manipulation, deepfakes, and children being exposed to NSFW material. Bills sponsored by Democrats tend to focus on things like general AI ethics and fairness, while bills sponsored by Republicans are more focused on data privacy rights and national security. There were clauses on AI deregulation originally in the Big Beautiful Bill, but it was such a sticking point for many republicans that it got taken out of the bill before passing. |  [Democratic Party Platform](https://www.democrats.org/party-platform) [Republican Party Platform](https://gop.com/platform/) [ANES (Section 2\)](http://www.electionstudies.org/nesguide/gd-index.htm) | [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/19/concern-over-the-impact-of-ai-on-2024-presidential-campaign/](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/19/concern-over-the-impact-of-ai-on-2024-presidential-campaign/)  [https://www.techpolicy.press/us-election-what-the-democratic-and-republican-parties-say-about-tech-policy/](https://www.techpolicy.press/us-election-what-the-democratic-and-republican-parties-say-about-tech-policy/)  |
| Congress | Well, congress has the right to make legislation, which ties into the recent bill passed by congress, the TAKE IT DOWN Act. This act aims to severely regulate and take down unwanted and unconsensual deepfake nudes. That is pretty much the only federal legislation passed by congress so far, but it passed with a 409-2 vote, so there’s clearly bipartisan support for some things. |  [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/) [The Hill](http://thehill.com/) | [https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/28/congress-deepfake-revenge-porn-law/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/28/congress-deepfake-revenge-porn-law/)  [https://time.com/7277746/ai-deepfakes-take-it-down-act-2025/](https://time.com/7277746/ai-deepfakes-take-it-down-act-2025/)  |
| Presidency | The POTUS has been posting loads of AI generated videos on the official White House X account, which may suggest that there is executive support from the White House for big tech companies to continue their innovation and improving generative AI platforms. Also, as mentioned previously, he met with many of the leading tech companies to discuss how much money they would be pumping into the US economy. The Biden administration actually did pass an executive order to do with AI, emphasizing how important it is that we invest in our AI infrastructure to remain ahead in the global economy. |  [White House Presidential Actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions)  | [https://www.wired.com/story/tech-ceos-donald-trump-white-house/](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-ceos-donald-trump-white-house/)  [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-team-keeps-posting-ai-portraits-of-him-and-we-keep-clicking](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-team-keeps-posting-ai-portraits-of-him-and-we-keep-clicking)  [https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/14/executive-order-on-advancing-united-states-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence-infrastructure/](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/14/executive-order-on-advancing-united-states-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence-infrastructure/)  |

| U.S. Supreme Court | While there have not yet been direct rulings on AI regulation policy yet by the supreme court, there are some adjacent cases that will have implications in this situation. In Loper  Bright  Enterprises v.  Raimondo (2024), the Court abandoned the longstanding “Chevron deference” rule, which required courts to defer to federal administrative agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes. This implies that this makes it harder for federal agencies to regulate new domains like AI without very clear statutory authority from Congress, because courts will no longer simply accept agency interpretations. Also, the Court’s use of the “Major Questions Doctrine”, which holds that for issues of vast economic or political significance, agencies must have clear congressional authorization, has been flagged as a barrier to sweeping federal AI regulation. |  [USSC](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [FindLaw](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court) | [https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-supreme-courts-major-questions-doctrine-and-ai-regulation/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-supreme-courts-major-questions-doctrine-and-ai-regulation/)  [https://newlinesinstitute.org/strategic-technology/how-the-u-s-should-regulate-artificial-intelligence-after-the-chevron-ruling/](https://newlinesinstitute.org/strategic-technology/how-the-u-s-should-regulate-artificial-intelligence-after-the-chevron-ruling/)  |
